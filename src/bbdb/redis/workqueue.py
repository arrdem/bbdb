  A helper type which represents a durable FIFO queue.

  the expectation that the user who removed it from the "waiting" queue will either delete it from
  the in flight queue when it is completed or return it to the waiting queue.

  WorkItems form a context manager which provides these semantics automatically. If an exception
  occurs in the context body, the WorkItem is considered to have failed and is returned to the
  pending queue, otherwise it is considered to have succeeded and is removed from the in flight
  queue.
